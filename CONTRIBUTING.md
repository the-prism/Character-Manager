# Contributing guidelines

In order to maintain some form of unity in the codebase, all code needs to be submitted via a pull request.
Furthermore, the pull request needs to pass the automated tests being ran.

## Stylecop

Stylecop is being used in the project to check and format the code in a way to be uniform.
When in development, those will show in visual studio as warnings.
Those warnings will permit you to build and run the code, however, when you submit a pull request the **automation required to pass will treat those warnings as error**.
Therefore make sure to adress those warnings before submitting a pull request.
